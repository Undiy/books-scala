# books-scala
A small webapp that I made as a test assignment.

You could make CRUD operation on a list of books and authors. Books and authors has a relation of one-to-many (not as many-to-many, as usual).

Made with Scala + Hibernate + JSF and built with Maven.

Tested on Tomcat with HSQL in-memory DB and PostgreSQL (db has to be created manually on the latter).
